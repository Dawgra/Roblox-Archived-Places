# ROrchive

Welcome to the ROrchive, a work in progress archive of Roblox games ranging from as far back as 2005 and even as recent as 2017. The purpose of this project is to archive as many classic Roblox games as possible, with a sister project being to reconstruct certain games to be playable on the modern Roblox client.
